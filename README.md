## Description
This pipeline is optimized for genome assembly of **Saccharomyces** using Oxford Nanopore R10.4 reads.

> ⚠️ **Note**: For larger or more complex genomes, additional sequencing technologies (e.g., PacBio HiFi, Hi-C, ONT ultralong) are recommended. This pipeline is not suited for such cases.

### Purpose
This repository is intended for de novo assembly of Saccharomyces strains for which (by default) R10.4 ONT are available.
Older chemistries require installing the appropriate version of medaka (see Dependencies below), increasing the round of polishing up to 3 and, change flye settings in ```scr/config```.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This pipeline is provided as-is. It will **not** be adapted for individual cases.

<details>
<summary> Old workflow </summary>
## Workflow
The pipeline consists of multiple sequential modules to generate a T2T genome assembly, polishing, quality control, telomere length estimation, ORFs identification and functional annotation. 
Below is an overview of each step:

### 1. Initialization & Pre-processing

- **`initiate`**: Sets up the directory structure and required files.
- **`precontig`**: Filters long reads before assembly, based on user-defined thresholds  
  *(default: minimum read length = 10 kb,  average read quality 15, target coverage = 50×)*.

  <details>
  <summary> Q len plot </summary>

      <img src="https://github.com/nicolo-tellini/T2TyDNA/blob/main/qlenplot.png" alt="logo pipe" width="50%"/>
    </p>
  </details>

### 2. Assembly

- **`contig`**: Performs de novo assembly using **Flye**.
- **`QUAST`** and **`BUSCO`**: Evaluate assembly quality and gene completeness.
- - **`mash`** and **`MUMmer`**

### 3. Intermediate Assessment

- **`assessment_after_contigs`** (**`mash`** and **`MUMmer`**): Aligns the draft assembly to a reference genome using **MUMmer**  
  *(reference genomes aree placed in the `rep/` directory and automatically selected)*.

### 4. Polishing

A three-step polishing process:

- **`minimap2` + `racon`**: One round of correction with ONT reads.
- **`medaka`**: Generates high-quality consensus (one round).
- **`assign_cent`**: Extracts centromere positions from the reference annotation and maps them to the new assembly.
-  **`reorderscaffolds`**: Names and orders contigs based on centromere positions.

> If multiple centromeres are found on the same contig (e.g., `IV_XIII`), this likely indicates an assembly artefact requiring manual inspection.

### 5. Telomere Length Estimation

- **`backmapping`**: Filtered ONT reads are mapped back to the de novo assembled genome.
- **`samtools`**: Extraction of reads mapping at the beginning and end of the chromosome (those covering a range of 20kb)
- **`telofinder`**: Detects telomeric repeats from the reads (Only terminal signals are maintained).

  </p>
</details>

### 6. Backmapping & Annotation

- **`backmapping`**: Maps filtered ONT reads back to the polished assembly. Useful to identify structural anomalies or coverage issues.
- **`annotation`**: Fast functional annotation with **eggNOG-mapper** for gene content overview.
  
  > ⚠️ **Note**: This is not intended to be a comprehensive genome annotation.

## Artefact Detection

Mummer plots help detect artefacts. Manual curation is necessary if the alignment shows the following patterns:

1. Telomers embedded in central chrs positions

      <img src="https://github.com/nicolo-tellini/T2TyDNA/blob/main/artefact.png" alt="Artifact ONT" width="70%"/>
    </p>
</details>

2. Local accumulation of unexpected SNPs  
3. Abrupt coverage drops  
4. Extensive soft/hard read clipping

    </p>
</details>

[TiGmint](https://github.com/bcgsc/tigmint) can support manual postprocessing, but it is not implemented in the pipeline as its use is case-specific.

## Dependencies

### Installation (recommended)

The pipeline relies on a set of established bioinformatics tools. 
The installation environment is named **t2tydna**. 

```sh
mamba create -n t2tydna python=3.10 -y
mamba activate t2tydna
```

The tools below can be installed as follows:

```sh
mamba install -y -c conda-forge -c bioconda \
    filtlong=0.2.1 \
    pytorch=2.3 \
    numpy \
    h5py \
    mappy \

    eggnog-mapper=2.1.13 \
    flye=2.9.6 \
    seqkit=2.10.* \
    quast=5.3.0 \
    busco=5.8.2 \

    pip \
    2>&1 | tee conda_install.log
```
> ⚠️ IMPORTANT: If you are not instered in telomere length estimates skip this step.

> TeloFinder need to be installed separately on a dirrente env following the instructions:

```
mamba create -n telofinder python=3.10

mamba activate telofinder

git clone https://github.com/GillesFischerSorbonne/telofinder.git

cd telofinder
```
> Before running ```pip install .``` follow the correction here listed at [issue13](https://github.com/GillesFischerSorbonne/telofinder/issues/13#issuecomment-2124729333)
> From the parental telofinder dir run:
```
pip install .
```

> By default telomere length estimates are disabled, you can activate it by changing the value of tel_len from "no" to "yes" in the ```./scr/config``` file.
> Telofinder accumulates pybedtools files on the temp dir consider removing that files at the end of each run. 

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT: If you are not instered in genome phasing skip this step.

```sh
mamba create -n clair3

mamba activate clair3

mamba install clair3 -c bioconda -c conda-forge

mamba deactivate

mamba create -n hapcut2

mamba activate hapcut2

mamba install hapcut2 -c bioconda -c conda-forge

mamba deactivate
```
### Annotation Step

The annotation process uses **eggNOG-mapper**, which requires a **local database** not included in the repository.  
To set it up manually:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/eggnog_db

download_eggnog_data.py --data_dir $HOME/eggnog_db
```
The pipeline expects to find the eggNOG database in:
```bash
$HOME/eggnog_db
```
If your database is located elsewhere, update the relevant variable in the config file accordingly.

## Download
 
:octocat: :
  
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nicolo-tellini/T2TyDNA.git
```

## Content

:open_file_folder: :

```{bash}
.
├── rep
│    └── README
├── scr
└── seq

3 directories 
```

- ```rep``` : repository with ref. assembly and annotations (see ScRapDB),</br>
- ```scr``` : scripts,</br>
- ```seq``` : put the FASTQs files here,</br>

### About the fastqs 

FASTQs data **must** be gziped and suffixed as samplename **.fastq.gz** (ont).
FASTQs are located inside seq dir. 

### About the rep dir 

Add a ref genome and the annotation according to the instruction in ```./rep/README```
Please note that **YLR163C.CBS432.fa MUST be kept**.
YLR163C is the gene located immediately after the rDNA on chromosome XII. It is mapped against the contigs to identify which contig represents the second half of chromosome XII, which is then merged with the first part. Be aware that this step **may introduce artefacts, so visual inspection and manual curation are required at the end of the run**. The PDF file in the  ```out ``` directory can be used to assess the correctness of this step. Even better it would be replacing YLR163C gene fasta with the one of the reference genome you are using and changing the code in mapYLR163C.sh script accordingly.
